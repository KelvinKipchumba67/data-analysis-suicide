# Suicide Data Analysis 

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository explores suicide rate trends in **Kenya** using publicly available datasets (Our World in Data / WHO).
The analysis focuses on:

* **National trends** (over years)
* **Gender differences** (male vs. female)
* **Age-specific risks**
* **Regional comparisons** (East Africa)
* **Statistical highlights** and visualization dashboards

The aim is to better understand **patterns, peaks, and drops** in suicide rates, and provide clear visual insights for research, advocacy, and policy.

## 📊 Analysis & Visualizations

* **Trend Analysis:** Male vs. female suicide rates over time
* **Age-Specific Insights:** Which age groups are most affected (e.g. 15–19 vs. 70+)
* **Heatmaps:** Suicide rates across years & age groups
* **Boxplots:** Variability in age group rates
* **Regional Comparisons:** Kenya vs. other East African countries
* **Statistical Highlights:** Mean, median, % changes, and male-to-female ratios

## 📈 Example Visualizations

* 📌 **Line charts** → Gender trends
* 📌 **Heatmap** → Age group + year patterns
* 📌 **Boxplots** → Statistical spread
* 📌 **Correlation analysis** → How age/gender trends move together
